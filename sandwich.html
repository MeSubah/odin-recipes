    <h1>Sandwich Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./sandwich.jpg" >
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese – it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.</p>
    <p>Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 slices white bread</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese..</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.
